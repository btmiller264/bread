        <ol>
          <li>
            Start with a simple bread
            <p>
              A simple and forgiving bread (such as Focaccia) will help you get into bread making.
              The ingredients are simple, and it will be a stepping stone to breads that take a little bit
              more time and effort. Not to say a bread like Focaccia isn't tasty in it's own right - it is!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Master a bread before moving on
            <p>
              This one goes along with the one above, but make sure to master a simple bread before moving on to
              another harder one. It will do a lot of good once you start making more advanced breads!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Get all your ingredients together beforehand
            <p>
              You don't want to be looking for the eggs when it is time to go. You are more likely to make 
              great bread when you adequately prepare beforehand and have everything you need.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Read the instructions
            <p>
              This goes along with the one above - you don't want to be reading the instructions and figure out
              that you needed to do something an hour ago that you didn't read. Again, preperation goes into
              making great bread.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a Digital Scale
            <p>
              If you don't have one, get one. This ensures accurate ingredients all across the board. Too
              much of one ingredient can turn a great bread into a meh bread that you don't end up eating.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't over or under knead your dough
            <p>
              Avoid over or under kneading your dough. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to stretch the dough
              out around 2 to 4 inches if you have kneaded it enough.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Have fun!
            <p>
              Unless it is your job (in that case, what are you doing here listening to a noob like me?), making
              bread is supposed to be fun! This isn't the middle ages, and you don't have to make bread to survive (I hope!).
              So have fun while doing it - it is supposed to be!
            </p>
